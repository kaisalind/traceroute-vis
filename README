Traceroute visualisation

The logic of how the Internet works may seem quite confusing at first. The traceroute command gives a good overview of how the data travels from one place to another. Since all these servers/computers are located somewhere physically, it can make the concept of Internet clearer if the route is shown on a map. 

Goal of the project is to initiate a traceroute command from the command line and use the output to visualise the route on a map.  

Requirements:
matplotlib
basemap
GeoLite2-City.mmdb (can be downloaded: http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/#Databases)
