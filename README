Traceroute visualisation

The logic of how the Internet works may seem quite confusing at first. The traceroute command gives a good overview of how the data travels from one place to another. Since all these servers/computers are located somewhere physically, it would make the concept of Internet even clearer if the route was shown on a map. 

Goal of the project is to initiate a traceroute command from the command line and use the output to visualise the route on a map.
